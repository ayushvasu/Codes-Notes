#YARN

Yet another resource negotiator

in 1.x HDFS and MapReduce

Hadoop Yarn Resource management

It is a layer that seprates the resource management layer and processing Layer
MapReduce2 moves resource management (like infrastructure to monitor node allocate the resource and schedule jobs) into YARN

MR1 
JobTracker is a master daemon
Responsible to assign and track task execution progress
TaskTracker are the slave daemon
They run on system where data node reside
Responsible to spawn a child jvm to execute Map Reduce and intermediate Task

Job Tracker now splits into two 

-Resources Manager -> manages the resource allocation in the cluster
-Application Master -> manages resource needs of individual application

Node manager is a generalized task tracker
A container executes as application specific process


Client - To submit the MR job
resources Manager - To manage the use of resource across the cluster
Container - Name given to a package os resources including RAM CPU and Network HDD
Node Manager - to oversee the container running on the cluster nodes
Application Master - which negotiates with the resource manager for resource and runs the application specific process in those cluster

Resource Manager 
Two Components scheduler and application manager
it is a global resource scheduler
Manages and allocates cluster resources

Application Master
Manages application life cycle and task scheduling
interacts with Resource manager and node manager
Application is a job submitted to the freamework

Node Manager
Manages single node resource allocation
Pre-node agent

Container Slot
Basic unit of allocation
Ex: container X= 2 GB, 1 CPU
Fine grained resource
